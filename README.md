🎯 Description of the project: Description of the project: This is an academic activity that I did as part of the MIT Xpro Full Stack Developer program. It consists of creating a route and giving movement to the icon, on a map.  It is like what Google does in its maps, when a route is indicated.

✨ How to run:  Work with DOM in JavaScript through mapbox which is an open-source platform that allows you to create and display maps on a web page. A code was added to the mapanimation.js. file and a marker were created and added to the map using mapboxgl's pre-built functions

🚀 Technologies:  JavaScript, HTML, Css, mapbox

✅ Requirements:  Installing Git and Copy the repository: https://github.com/ClaudiaLopezLagosGlez/RealTimeBusTracker.git

♻️ Roadmap of future improvements: Add Route Icons.
Improve the design with Boostrap.
